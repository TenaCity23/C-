# C++
A portfolio of C++ Projects


## Main Projects
In the [main_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/main_projects) folder is a compilation of my best C++ Projects that I have completed. Here are some of my highlighted main projects: 

* [Counting Time](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/main_projects/CountingTime)
* [TicTacToe](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/main_projects/TicTacToe)
* [UFO Hangman](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/main_projects/UFO_Hangman)


## Object Oriented Programming
In the [OOP_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/OOP_projects) folder are projects that I have done using the four principles of Object Oriented Programming, which include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts are important in my journey of learning how to program. Here are some of my highligthed OOP projects: 

* [D.P. App](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/OOP_projects/Dating_Profile_App)


## Algorithm & Data Structure Projects
In the [A&DS_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/A%26DS_projects) folder are projects that I have completed using my knowledge of Algorithm and Data Structures. These are works that I believe are useful and important in learning more about programming and solving complex problems. Here are some of my highlighted projects: 

* [Bleep](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/A%26DS_projects/bleep.cpp)
* [LinkedList Practice](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/A&DS_projects/LinkedList)
* [Recursive Factorial](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/A%26DS_projects/recursiveFactorial.cpp)


## Other Projects
Some other miscellaneous projects I've completed could be found in the [other_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/other_projects) folder. These are often project exercises I completed for fun and practice! Here are some of my highlighted practice projects:

### [Games](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/other_projects/Games):
* [Rock, Paper, Scissors!](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Games/rpc.cpp)
* [Harry Potter Sorting Hat](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Games/sortingHat.cpp)
* [Whale Talk](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Games/whaletalk.cpp)
* [Magic 8 Ball](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Games/8_Ball.cpp)

### [Practice](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/other_projects/Practice):
* [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Practice/Fibonacci.cpp)
* [Basic Sorting: Array of Numbers](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Practice/BasicSortingNumbers.cpp)
* [Basic Palindrome](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Practice/basic_palindrome.cpp)
* [Factors of a Number](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Practice/factors.cpp)
