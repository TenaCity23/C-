# C++
A portfolio of C++ Projects

## Main Projects
In the [main_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/main_projects) folder is a compilation of my best C++ Projects that I have completed. Here are some of my highlighted main projects: 

* [TicTacToe](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/main_projects/TicTacToe)
* [UFO Hangman](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/main_projects/UFO_Hangman)

## Algorithm & Data Structure Projects
In the [A&DS_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/A%26DS_projects) folder are projects that I have completed using my knowledge of algorithm and data structures. These are works that I believe are useful and important in learning more about programming and solving complex problems. Here are some of my highlighted projects: 

* [Recursive Factorial](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/A%26DS_projects/recursiveFactorial.cpp)

## Other Projects
Some other miscellaneous projects I've completed could be found in the [other_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/other_projects) folder. These are often project exercises I completed for fun and practice! Here are some of my highlighted practice projects:

### [Games](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/other_projects/Games):
* [Rock, Paper, Scissors!](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Games/rpc.cpp)
* [Harry Potter Sorting Hat](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Games/sortingHat.cpp)
* [Magic 8 Ball](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Games/8_Ball.cpp)

### [Practice](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/tree/main/other_projects/Practice):
* [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Practice/Fibonacci.cpp)
* [Basic Sorting: Array of Numbers](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Practice/BasicSortingNumbers.cpp)
* [Basic Palindrome](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP/blob/main/other_projects/Practice/basic_palindrome.cpp)
